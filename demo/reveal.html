        <div>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div>(I know, that seemed obvious to me too)</div>

        <div>From the presenter interface, you can show viewers a QR code</div>
        <div>to let them connect and view your presentation</div>
        <div>on their mobile device, and ask questions as you go.</div>
        <div>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div>YOU control the flow of questions, meaning</div>
        <div>no one has to wait to ask,</div>
        <div>and no one has to interrupt.</div>

        <h2>WANT MORE?</h2>
        <div>Round Table is the original title of the project,</div>
        <div>developed during a Hackathon in Dec. 2012.</div>
        <div>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div>Round Table was created by Drew Strickland</div>
        <div>and Annie MacMackin, two innovative and driven hackers.</div>
        <div>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div>This same technology will be used to create a platform</div>
        <div>for use by presenters and educators. &nbsp;Stay tuned.</div>
